The site will do just one thing. It will calculate working days. 
For example, 7 working days from today means, If today is 5 April 2024, then after 7 working days it will be 16 April, as there are two weekends in between, weekends are Friday and saturday.

Also, public holidays will be considered. Public holidays will be provided beforehand in a list.

This is a late night Pair programming with Chatgpt To develop an static web application purely based on HTML, CSS and JS. No framework whatsoever. 

I started 1:30AM and Now it 03:43AM. The end result looks like

Observations:  
1. Breaking down tasks is the most important factor when developing app with an LLM.
2. Prompt with example data format, data processing steps with examples works best than just asking it to solve a problem. For example, to create desired UI I provided with hand sketches. And the output quality improved tremendously.
3. With clear and incremental instructions, coding with ChatGPT is way faster than I imagined.
4. ChatGPT is a ninja with CSS. I encourged it to not use any framework, To use only pure HTML, CSS and javascript. The output looks really polished. I am not well versed with frontend technologies. The result at the end of a 2 hour session is so much that, It might have taken 13-17 hours to produce this on my own.
5. Its really great at debugging its code or reasoning process. If we ask it to look back and look for mistakes,it can come up with source of error and solution. 
8. ChatGPT makes mistakes, forgets about small details sometimes. We definitly need to put code review here too.
